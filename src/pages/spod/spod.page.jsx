                    Spod Integrated is a private company based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.

                    request for a service directly from the site.

                    <p id="spod-stack-why-description">
                        This project is generally for informative purposes so a simple
                        SPA architecture like React with pages that loaded up almost instantly seemed like a good fit.
                        React's state management also made it easy to handle fetches and control behaviours reacting to any state changes.
                        The project is hosted with Hostgator as they had a hosting plan that covered emails which is the primary way to
                        contact the company from the site. I went with PHP to handle the email backend logic as the hosting plan
                        didn't cover Node.js for the backend.
                        <br /><br />
                        I personally prefer to use Scss for styling when I have to decide mostly because it feels like
                        vanilla CSS with a few super powers. Yes, yes I like vanilla CSS haha.

                    <p id="spod-problems-description">
                        Figuring out the simplest way to handle email requests was easily the biggest challenge I had
                        because, initially, I hadn't realized that the Hostgator plan didn't cover Node.js code.
                        <br /><br />
                        So after a few hours wondering what I did wrong to get Express and nodemailer mad at me,
                        I found out I had to find a 'non-node' way to handle emails.
                        <br />
                        I didn't have much experience setting up
                        emails at the time so I wasn't hundred percent aware of all the options out there.
                        <br /><br />
                        I had to comb through articles to decide which was worth trying and was a good fit for my
                        situation. I eventually decided it would be simpler to just use PHP.
                        <br /><br />
                        React router's navigation in production was a minor issue I had to solve.
                        I found an article on how to deal with this if your site is hosted on a platform like
                        Hostgator {' '}

                        This project helped me get used to hosting react projects on sites that
                        aren't built to host SPAs right off the bat. I learned more about
                        DNSs and got better working with custom emails.
