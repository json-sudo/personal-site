                        The course covers everything state management from hooks, context api, graphql,
                        and more. After spending time with each one, I decided to leave the ones
                        I felt most comfortable with in the codebase - like a get-together of state management
                        tools of some sort. I used redux, without sagas, context api and hooks. Some functionality,
                        like signing in the user if it's the same visitor to the app, would be most efficiently handled
                        with a lifecycle method. So a class-based component was used for this.

                        The client code of this project was separated into a different folder
                        with the server at the root. So for a little while I had trouble
                        setting up the build command on netlify. Again, I had to figure out
                        how to handle react routing on production but for netlify this time.
                        I found an article {' '}

                        {' '} that helped with this. I needed a netlify.toml file as explained in the netlify docs
                        as well.

                    <p id="crown-lessons-description">
                        This project helped me learn a lot of state management tools that can be used with
                        react. I, more importantly, learned when each would be more useful than the other
                        as with all programming tools really.
                        <br /><br />
                        To make the project a little less generic, I styled it my own way, brought in a
                        little color scheme and separated the sign in and sign up pages. I also worked a
                        lot on the app's accessibility and plan to add a few more features and improvements
                        like a means for the user to see a record of everything they've 'ordered' on the app
                        to further improve the project's semblance to something in the real world and improve
                        the contact page's content.
