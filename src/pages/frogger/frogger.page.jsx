                    Frogger is a classic arcade game that I remade as part of my
                    nanodegree coursework. The project was intended to test my understanding
                    of javascript at that point and I had fun making it my own way as well.

                        Well, mostly, I had to. The project was designed to test how much I'd learned
                        about OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts and not cooking up spaghetti code.
                        It was a lovely challenge at the time and I enjoyed taking it on.

                        My biggest challenge working on this project, which was more engaging than it was
                        frustrating thankfully, was figuring out how to listen for swipe movements
                        on touch screens. I found an article that helped with this and then I figured the rest from there.<br />
                        <br />
                        I had to spend time setting up speed levels for the bugs and sprite, setting up logic for
                        when felt natural to make the sprite collide with the bugs. I tried out different values and
                        eventually settled on what I felt was good enough.

                    <p id="frogger-lessons-description">
                        I learned how to listen for touch events. I had fun practising my ternary operators.
                        I also improved my research skills.
                        <br /><br />
                        I felt swiping was a more intuitive action while playing the game on mobile touch screens so
                        I felt I'd add that instead of putting buttons to work similarly to the keyboard listeners.
                        I also added a timed mode where you had two minutes to score as many points as you can. I also
                        tried to style the project in a unique way and ended up achieving that.
